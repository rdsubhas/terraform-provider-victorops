  title: VictorOps API
  description: |
    This API allows you to interact with the VictorOps platform in various ways. Your account may be limited
    to a total number of API calls per month. Also, some of these API calls have rate limits.

    NOTE: In this documentation when creating a sample curl request (clicking the TRY IT OUT! button), in some API
    viewing interfaces, the '@' in an email address may be encoded. Please note that the REST endpoints will not
    process the encoded version. Make sure that the encoded character '%40' is changed to its unencoded form before
    submitting the curl request.

          The strategy you would like to use to replace the user. They work as follows
          specifiedUser - replace the deleted user with a specific user. If using
                         this strategy, you MUST provide the `replacement` field
                         as well. This is also the default strategy. So, if you
                         provide no replacementStrategy in your request, you are
                         still required to provide a `replacement` field.
          globalAdmin - replace the deleted user with the first Global Admin for the
                        organization.
          teamAdmin - replace the deleted user in rotations/escalation policies with
                      the team admin for the team related to that rotation or escalation
                      policy. This strategy REQUIRES that every team have an admin that
                      is not the deleted user.
